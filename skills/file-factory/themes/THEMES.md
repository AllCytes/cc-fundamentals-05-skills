## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Present Theme Options

When a user requests styling or theming for an artifact:

1. List the available themes with brief descriptions
2. Mention the context/use cases for each theme (if relevant)
3. Ask the user to select their preferred theme

### Step 2: Apply the Selected Theme

Once a theme has been chosen:

1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `presets/` directory
2. Extract the color palette and typography specifications
3. Apply the theme consistently throughout the artifact:
   - **Primary colors**: Use for main headings, key elements, and backgrounds
   - **Accent colors**: Use for highlights, callouts, and emphasis
   - **Neutral colors**: Use for body text, secondary backgrounds
   - **Headers**: Apply the specified header font
   - **Body text**: Apply the specified body font

### Step 3: Ensure Consistency

When applying a theme:
- Maintain proper contrast ratios for readability
- Use colors consistently across all slides/pages/sections
- Apply font styles uniformly for similar content types
- Preserve the theme's visual identity throughout

## Creating Custom Themes

If none of the existing themes fit the user's needs:

1. Ask the user for preferences (colors, mood, industry, style)
2. Generate a custom theme similar to the preset format
3. Show the custom theme for review and approval
4. Apply it following the same process as preset themes
