## Usage Instructions

### Generating Multi-File Output

1. Set `output_mode: multi` in extraction configuration
2. Enable desired file types in `multi_file_structure`
3. Specify `output_directory` for generated files
4. Run extraction - files are created automatically

### Customizing Templates

- Copy relevant sections for your content type
- Remove unused sections (e.g., no code = skip code-examples.md)
- Adjust table of contents to match actual content
- Update navigation links between files

### File Generation Order

Recommended order for creating files:
1. **INDEX.md** - Create skeleton first, update counts after extraction
2. **summary.md** - High-level overview helps frame other content
3. **workflows.md** - Core procedural content
4. **commands.md** - Reference material
5. **golden-nuggets.md** - Insights and quotes
6. **code-examples.md** - Technical snippets
7. **INDEX.md** - Final update with accurate counts and cross-references

### Consolidation Notes

When consolidating multiple videos:
- Use INDEX.md to track sources per section
- Add "Source: Video X" annotations within files
- Build cross-references in INDEX.md topic table
- See [consolidation-extraction.md](../cookbook/consolidation-extraction.md) for full guide
